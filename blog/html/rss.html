<p>I’ve just realised I worry about whether I’m wasting time, and this causes me
to waste time.</p>
<p>For example, I don’t meditate because it seems like a waste of time, but
instead I do something else that wastes time like reading a book or playing
Xbox or watching TV.</p>
<p>I feel that I should be doing something productive, like learning the piano
or contributing to open source software or doing some other sort of constructive
and worthy hobby. So I don’t allow myself to literally sit and do nothing,
or go for a walk, or meditate. But I don’t do the worthy thing either. I just
do an activity that takes my mind off the fact that I’m alive and have too many
choices.</p>
<p>I even have that with meeting friends. Meeting friends feels like a waste of
time because we often talk about ourselves or bore each other in another way.
And it takes time to get there, and it takes time to arrange it.</p>
<p>I also don’t do chores or life-admin when I probably should, because it feels
like a waste of time doing something that merely maintains my life when I should
be doing something where I’m ‘thriving’ as opposed to ‘surviving’. This means
I have a background level of anxiety that there are various things unresolved.</p>
<p>There is no final accounting at the end of your life. Nobody checks whether
what you did was enriching or worthy. Designating one activity as better than
another based on something other than the effect it has on you and others is
complete folly, but it’s a large part of how I choose what to do. It’s like
I assign activities ‘presige points’ on top of the actual value they have
to me and others, and I give out a lot more ‘prestige points’ than ‘real
points’. Then I don’t do the thing with the most points because I’m aware
of how stupid the system is and I just do something that prevents me
thinking about it!</p>
<p>I should just live my life, doing what’s immediately in front of me without
thinking about whether what I’m doing is somehow optimal. I should just do
whatever I really feel like doing. Sometimes what I feel like doing is the most
self-indulgent thing, but sometimes it isn’t. It’s often the thing that will
give me the deepest happiness and make me better to those around me.</p>
